Zombie Destroyer

Your objective is to move around the board and kill all the zombies without dying.

You move around the board by making your player face a specific direction, either up, down, left or right, and then moving forward one space.

You kill a zombie by hitting the stab button when a zombie is in the space directly in front of you.
